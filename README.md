# Project Accordian
Are you lazy? I am. I have decided that I can no longer be bothered to move my fingers when typing (which I do a lot). The only solution: design a new keyboard.

Okay, it stems from more than pure laziness, but its close to the truth. I want a more efficient keyboard workflow that can be easily applied to a portable device and still be as fully featured as a full ~100 key keyboard.

The solution? Project Accordian! Left four fingers select the set of keys to type from (A-H for example), right four fingers can be used to type. This gives a possible (2^4 * 8) easy-to-access key combinations, pleanty to access the full power of a normal keyboard. Modifier keys (ctrl, shift, alt, super) can be accessed via the four thumb keys (four per thumb for combination convenience).

The name stems from the device's similarity in operation to an accordian (as pointed out by a colleague).

The source for the arduino code, the electronic circuit diagram, and the 3D printable body mesh will be uploaded here.

Learning to type on a new keyboard is an arduous task (do you remember how slow you were when you first touched a QWERTY keyboard?). Here are a few links that could be handy.
